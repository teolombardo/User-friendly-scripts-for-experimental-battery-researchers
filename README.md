# User-friendly Scripts for Experimental Battery Researachers

Here you can find a series of codes made for battery researchers that are not experts on coding and that can be useful to save time and get the maximum out of your data.
These codes can be used either for analyzing your electrochemical data (cycle life or rate capability tests), your (FIB-)SEM images (for both electrodes and powders), and your Time-of-Flight Seconday-Ion-Masss-Spectrometry data.

Each folder contains one or more codes that can be run by simply filling an associated Excel file (containing the inputs needed for the code), therefore not requiring any previous coding experience. 
For this, you will, however, need to install Python or Jupyter Notebook (for instance through Anaconda). This should be done only for the first utilization, and you can find many tutorials explaining how to install those software (don't worry, it is extremely easy).

For some of these codes, an executable version (not requiring installing any software) is also available. Unfortunately, however, due to their size, it was not possible to upload them here. In case you are interested to obtain those executables, please feel free to contact me through GitHub.

Each folder contains a documentation file explaining how to use each code.


Hoping these tools will be of help to your research!
